Objective: Enable HR leaders to identify high-risk attrition segments, monitor engagement, and design targeted retention strategies.

I Built & Published an interactive HR analytics dashboard to analyze employee attrition trends, job satisfaction, and workforce demographics using Power BI and DAX.

Insights Derived:
• Total Employees: 1,470
• Attrition Count: 237
• Attrition Rate: 16.12%
• Average Salary: 6.5K | Average Tenure: 7 years | Avg. Age: 37

• Highest attrition (49%) comes from employees earning below 5K salary, suggesting compensation is a key retention factor.
• Age group 26–35 shows the highest turnover (116 employees) — mid-career professionals are at greatest risk of leaving.
• Life Sciences (38%) and Medical (27%) degree holders dominate the workforce, but also show higher churn in operational roles.
• Laboratory Technicians (62) and Sales Executives (57) experience the highest attrition by job role.
• Employees with fewer than 2 years at the company show the sharpest drop-off (59 leavers), indicating onboarding/engagement issues.
• Male attrition (140) exceeds female attrition (79), but the gap narrows in high-skill R&D roles.
• Job satisfaction levels cluster around mid-scale (3/5) — indicating moderate engagement with room for improvement.
• Attrition rate: 16.12%, mainly driven by employees earning below 5K.
• Most attrition in the 26–35 age group and early tenure employees (<2 years).
• Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives face the highest turnover.
• Job satisfaction averages around level 3, signaling engagement challenges.

Tools & Techniques Used:
